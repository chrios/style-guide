# style-guide

Local database storage
A user of your site should be able to enter, retrieve, change, and delete information held in a database
Input should be validated in browser
You should use form elements for user input
An example feature may be to “pin” components and styles to a favourites list, which provide in-page links back to them.
Be creative, just because you’re not accessing a “real” back-end doesn’t mean you can’t pretend you are

Feature: Component shopping list
Users add components to a shopping cart which they can email back to themselves.

Event listeners
A user should be able to perform actions on your site based on interaction with a page
Demonstrate event listeners within your components, using a range of event types
Feature Detection
Not all browsers are created equally, a good developer accounts for the these shortcomings
Add pollyfills or libraries where necessary for essential features to work across older browsers 
If a feature doesn’t work with a specific browser it should fail gracefully where possible, or display a warning as a last resort. 

Feature: smooth scrolling
Combine into one page, users can scroll by clicking or pressing menu items.
